The SparkFun HSTX to DVI Breakout takes the 22-pin interface found on the HSTX connector on the IoT RedBoard - RP2350 as well as the camera and display connectors on a Rasbperry Pi 5 and translates it to an HDMI connector for DVI output.

The board includes a 22-pin flex cable connector and HDMI connector along with the required components to level shift and boost the voltage for compatability with DVI signal requirements.
